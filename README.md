# Advanced House Price Prediction

# Description:

- When envisioning their dream home, most people don't start with the technical details like basement ceiling height or railroad proximity. However, in the realm of real estate, these factors, among others, significantly impact the final price of a property. In this project, we delve into the intricate world of residential real estate pricing, aiming to predict the final price of homes in Ames, Iowa.



# Dataset Overview:

- The dataset provided for this project comprises 79 explanatory variables, detailing almost every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. This rich dataset offers a comprehensive view of the various factors influencing house prices, presenting a challenging landscape for predictive modeling.

# Challenges:

- The primary challenges in this project stem from the high dimensionality of the dataset and the extensive preprocessing and cleaning required. With a multitude of features to consider, understanding their significance and handling missing values, outliers, and categorical variables becomes paramount. Additionally, the dataset may contain inconsistencies and noise, necessitating thorough data cleaning to ensure reliable model performance.

# Project Steps:

   **1-** Data Collection: Gathered the dataset containing information about residential homes in Ames, Iowa.
   
   **2-** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted an in-depth analysis of the dataset to gain insights into the features and their relationships with the target variable (house prices).

   **3-** Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset by handling missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.

   **4-** Feature Selection: Identified the most relevant features for predicting house prices, considering factors such as correlation, importance, and domain knowledge.

   **5-** Model Selection and Tuning: Explored various regression algorithms, including linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting, to identify the best-performing model. Employed techniques such as cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

   **6-** Final Model Selection: Chose the most suitable regression model based on evaluation metrics and generalization performance.

   **7-** Deployment: Deployed the final model for real-world use, allowing stakeholders to predict house prices based on relevant features. A video demonstration of the deployment process is provided for reference.
